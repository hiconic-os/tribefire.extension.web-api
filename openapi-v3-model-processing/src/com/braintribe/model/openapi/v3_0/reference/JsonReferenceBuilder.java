/**
 * A JsonReferenceBuilder helps building a JSON reference (https://json-spec.readthedocs.io/reference.html) which is
 * modeled via deriving from the {@link JsonReferencable} entity.
 * <p>
 * A JSON reference object holds a String key describing a path how to get to the respective entity. The actual entities are
 * stored in a pool (a map from a String ID to the entity) which also must be referencable by a known JSON reference
 * key. That means that the JSON reference key will consist of the JSON reference key of the pool plus its own unique
 * key.
 * <p>
 * This builder's task is to
 * <ol>
 * <li>Determine the JSON reference key for a specific entity
 * <li>Ensure that an entity exists with that key in the pool.
 * <li>If not, create it in the current JsonReferencingContext and store it in the pool. ( {@link #ensure(Function)} )
 * <li>Return a reference object in the correct type with that key ( {@link #getRef()} )
 * </ol>
